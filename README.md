# 🌧️ Automatic Rainwater Sensing Umbrella

An innovative embedded systems project that automates the deployment of an umbrella in response to rainfall. This smart system uses a rain sensor to detect water droplets and triggers a gear motor to extend the umbrella canopy via a rack and pinion mechanism. Controlled by an Arduino Uno, the setup demonstrates practical integration of sensors, actuators, and microcontroller-based logic.
